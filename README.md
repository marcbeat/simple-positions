# Simple Positions
## Saving and Loading Positions [Client/Server]

This mod lets you save the coordinates of your current position and retrieve them later on via commands. You can give your positions names and even add them to a custom list!
If you want to get a previously saved position, simply search for its name, list and dimension and retrieve its coordinates in your chat.
All positions are saved to a JSON file, so you have total control over your data.
For usage instructions please consult the wiki.

**TLDR:**

Saving position:
```
/pos set <dimension>.<list>.<name>
```
Retrieving position:
```
/pos get <dimension>.<list>.<name>
```
